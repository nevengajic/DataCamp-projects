-- The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. 

It's a show. In this notebook, you're going to find out how some of this show's elements interact. 

After exploring and cleaning our data a little, I answered questions like:

What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does the game affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad costs evolved over time?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
